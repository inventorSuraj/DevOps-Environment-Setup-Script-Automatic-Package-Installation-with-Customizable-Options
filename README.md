# DevOps-Environment-Setup-Script-Automatic-Package-Installation-with-Customizable-Options
This is a Bash script that automates the setup of a complete development environment for DevOps engineers. The script identifies which package manager is running and installs various tools, configurations, and dependencies that are commonly used by DevOps engineers.
Prerequisites
The script requires a Bash shell and one of the following package managers to be installed on the system:

apt-get (for Debian-based systems)
yum (for Red Hat-based systems)
brew (for macOS)
If the apt-get package manager is not installed on your system, the script will attempt to install it automatically.

Usage
To use the script, simply download the devops-setup.sh file and run it in your terminal:

bash
Copy code
$ bash devops-setup.sh
The script will prompt you if you want to continue with the automatic installation of the packages, and give you the option to either install everything without further questions, select packages to install step by step, open a Github link for help, or terminate the script.

If you choose to install packages step by step, the script will prompt you for each package in the list and you can type y to install or n to skip the package.
